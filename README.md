# 🏠 Airbnb Database Design & Implementation Project

## 📘 About the Project
This project is part of the **ALX Airbnb Database Module**, focusing on the design, normalization, and implementation of a relational database system for an Airbnb-like application.  
It simulates a real-world production environment emphasizing scalability, data integrity, and professional standards in database development.

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
Through this project, I aim to:
- Apply advanced **database design principles** to model complex systems.
- Master **normalization** techniques up to 3NF to improve data efficiency.
- Use **SQL DDL** for schema creation and indexing for performance.
- Write **SQL DML scripts** to seed realistic Airbnb-like data.
- Enhance **collaboration and documentation** through GitHub workflows.

## 🧩 Project Tasks

### **Task 1: Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD)**
- Designed an ERD using **Draw.io** to visualize key entities and relationships:
  - Users
  - Properties
  - Bookings
  - Payments  
- Ensured clear relationship definitions and cardinalities.

### **Task 2: Database Normalization**
- Applied normalization up to **3rd Normal Form (3NF)** to reduce redundancy and improve efficiency.
- Documented the normalization steps from unnormalized tables to 3NF.

### **Task 3: SQL Schema Creation**
- Used **DDL (Data Definition Language)** to create the database schema.
- Implemented **primary keys**, **foreign keys**, and **indexes** for performance optimization.
- Followed **naming conventions** and best practices.

### **Task 4: Data Seeding**
- Populated tables with realistic sample data for:
  - Users  
  - Properties  
  - Bookings  
  - Payments  
- Scripts designed to simulate real Airbnb scenarios.

## 🧠 Tools & Technologies
| Category | Tools Used |
|-----------|-------------|
| Database | PostgreSQL / MySQL |
| Modeling | Draw.io |
| Version Control | Git & GitHub |
| Scripting | SQL (DDL & DML) |
| Documentation | Markdown (README) |

## ⚙️ Implementation Workflow
1. Design ERD in **Draw.io** and export as `ERD.png`.
2. Apply normalization (document in `Normalization.md`).
3. Write schema scripts (`schema.sql`).
4. Add data seeding scripts (`seed.sql`).
5. Test in your local DBMS (MySQL/PostgreSQL).
6. Push all files to GitHub repository.

---

## 🧾 Deliverables
- `ERD.png`
- `Normalization.md`
- `schema.sql`
- `seed.sql`
- `README.md`

## 🌟 Reflections
This project has strengthened my ability to translate **real-world business models into efficient database systems**.  
It reinforces the backend knowledge needed for my career path as a **Cloud Engineer and DevOps professional**, especially in **data automation and infrastructure management**.
